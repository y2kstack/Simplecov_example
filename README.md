# Simplecov_example

SimpleCov is a Ruby library that can be used to measure the test coverage of your Ruby application. It works by analyzing the source code of your application and identifying which lines of code are executed when the tests are run. The results are presented in a report that shows the percentage of code that is covered by tests, and highlights the areas that have low test coverage.

To use SimpleCov, you first need to install it as a gem. You can do this by adding the following line to your Gemfile:

```
gem 'simplecov'
And then run bundle install

```
Once you have SimpleCov installed, you need to require it in your test files. You can do this by adding the following line to your test helper file:

```
require 'simplecov' 
SimpleCov.start
```
Once you have SimpleCov set up, you can run your tests as you normally would. After the tests have been run, SimpleCov will generate a report that shows the test coverage for your application.

For example, if you have a simple Ruby application that has a single class called Calculator with two methods, add and subtract, you can write test for the class, and run it using SimpleCov, you will get the percentage of the code that was covered by the tests and the percentage that was not.

You can also configure SimpleCov to exclude certain files or directories from the coverage report, set minimum coverage thresholds, and generate HTML, JSON or XML reports.

It's important to note that test coverage is not the only metric to measure the quality of the code, it's just one of the many. You should also consider other metrics like code complexity, maintainability, and readability.
