# Simplecov_example

SimpleCov is a Ruby library that can be used to measure the test coverage of your Ruby application. It works by analyzing the source code of your application and identifying which lines of code are executed when the tests are run. The results are presented in a report that shows the percentage of code that is covered by tests, and highlights the areas that have low test coverage.

To use SimpleCov, you first need to install it as a gem. You can do this by adding the following line to your Gemfile:

```
gem 'simplecov'
And then run bundle install

```
Once you have SimpleCov installed, you need to require it in your test files. You can do this by adding the following line to your test helper file:

```
require 'simplecov' 
SimpleCov.start
```
Once you have SimpleCov set up, you can run your tests as you normally would. After the tests have been run, SimpleCov will generate a report that shows the test coverage for your application.

For example, if you have a simple Ruby application that has a single class called Calculator with two methods, add and subtract, you can write test for the class, and run it using SimpleCov, you will get the percentage of the code that was covered by the tests and the percentage that was not.

You can also configure SimpleCov to exclude certain files or directories from the coverage report, set minimum coverage thresholds, and generate HTML, JSON or XML reports.

It's important to note that test coverage is not the only metric to measure the quality of the code, it's just one of the many. You should also consider other metrics like code complexity, maintainability, and readability.


####

In SimpleCov, primary coverage and branch coverage are two different types of test coverage that can be used to measure the quality of your tests.

Primary coverage refers to the percentage of lines of code that are executed by your tests. It's a simple measure of how much of your code is covered by tests. SimpleCov calculates primary coverage by counting the number of lines of code that are executed by your tests and dividing that by the total number of lines of code in your application.

Branch coverage, on the other hand, refers to the percentage of branches (conditional statements) in your code that are exercised by your tests. A branch is considered to be exercised when both the true and false paths are taken by the test. Branch coverage is a more advanced measure of test coverage as it takes into account not only if the code is executed but also if the different paths of a conditional statement are covered.

SimpleCov calculates branch coverage by counting the number of branches that are exercised by your tests and dividing that by the total number of branches in your application.

Both primary and branch coverage are important to consider when evaluating the quality of your tests, primary coverage gives you a general idea of how much of your code is covered by tests, while branch coverage gives you a more detailed understanding of how well your tests are exercising the different paths in your code.
